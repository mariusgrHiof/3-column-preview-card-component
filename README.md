## My process

I started to structure the HTML and then adding CSS. At the end I created media queries to make the site responsive on tablet and mobile devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned how to utilize flexbox to layout my page and make it responsive on tablet and mobile devices.

### Continued development

I'm going to enhance my HTML and CSS skills by continue creating more sites.

### Useful resources
